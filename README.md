# DCIT 318: Programming II â€“ Assignment 2

This repository contains three C# console applications demonstrating object-oriented programming principles for my DCIT 318 course at the University of Ghana.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
1. **Inheritance and Method Overriding**  
   Demonstrates basic inheritance by defining a base `Animal` class and two derived classes (`Dog` and `Cat`) that override the `MakeSound()` method.

2. **Abstract Classes**  
   Shows how abstract classes work by creating an abstract `Shape` class with a method `CalculateArea()`, and concrete implementations in `Circle` and `Rectangle`.

3. **Interfaces**  
   Defines an `IMovable` interface and implements it in `Car` and `Bicycle` classes, each with their own `Move()` behavior.
